# ❄️ United Arctic Protogada

Welcome to the mythic sanctum of **United Arctic Protogada**—a faction-neutral portal built to empower students, creators, and lorekeepers through ritualized knowledge, ultra-affordable hosting, and symbolic design.

This site is inspired by the clarity and structure of [MathIsFun.com](https://mathisfun.com), but reimagined through the lens of UA’s seasonal arcs, factional politics, and creative autonomy.

- Factional tabs and symbolic navigation
- Creative tools and mythic metaphors
- Memorials to fallen players and forgotten builds
